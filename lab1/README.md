# Lab1 Tasks

## Task 2
- Store the breast-cancer.txt file in Panda's dataframe
- Drop the missing or non-numeric values
- Drop the ID column
- Create features and labels arrays X and y
- Scale/Standardize the features array X (use Minmax or Standard scaling). See the documentations online.
- Transform the feature array y to a binary array 0 or 1
- Split the arrays into training and test arrays (4 resulting arrays)

## Task 3
- Load the GD_Example.txt into a numpy array, from the data folder of this repo.
- Plot the data points
- Implement the cost function
- Using gradient descent algorithm with 500 iterations, find the best fitting line characterized by: 𝑚𝑥 + 𝑏. (determine m and b)
- Plot the final fitting line alongside with the scattered data points.
