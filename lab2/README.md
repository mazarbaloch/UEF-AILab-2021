# Lab 2 Tasks

## Task 1
### Implement a single layer neural network (Perceptron) to represent the following Boolean functions: AND, OR, NOR (NOT OR) 

- Generate input and output (X and y) samples for each Boolean function (4 samples for each function).
- Implement a single layer neural network as in the lecture slides (2 inputs and 1 output). 
- Implement the feedforward operations.
- Implement the backpropagation using gradient descent algorithm.
- Train and test the neural network.
- Print the results 
- Improve the neural network to represent XOR Boolean function.
